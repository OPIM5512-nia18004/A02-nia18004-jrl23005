# A02 - Nikhileshwar Anaparthi (NIA18004) & Jennifer Leach (JRL23005)

The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to train a Neural Network in Python, and enhance our collaboration skills with GitHub. This involved learning how to collaborate through branches and pull requests on GitHub, and gaining experience on reviewing and giving feedback on other's code. 

This project used the California Housing dataset within the sklearn.datasets package in Python.

In order to run this script, you must do the following:

1. Clone the Respository in GitHub Desktop.
2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code and make sure Python 3.12 (or similar) is set as the virtual environment.
3. Install the required packages by doing: python install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the A02.py script by doing: python src/A02.py
After doing this, you should see three images in the repository's figs folder. 

The figures produced from this code are as follows: 
1. Training_Act_vs_Pred.png: A scatterplot showing the accuracy of our model on the Training set. It plots the actual values from the dataset, compared to the predicted values produced from our Neural Network. 
2. Test_Act_vs_Pred.png: A scatterplot similar to Training_Act_vs_Pred.png, except now focused on the Testing set. Similarly, it plots the actual values from the dataset, compared to the predicted values produced from our Neural Network. 
3. Training_Loss.png: Shows a graphical display of the training loss as the neural network runs through multiple epochs. It helps us see if our Neural Network is modeling and training the data accurately, as well as how long it took the model to converage.
